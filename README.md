# ðŸ§¬ Maze Solver with Genetic Algorithm

This project shows how a **Genetic Algorithm** can solve a maze. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and runs directly in your browser. No setup needed!

##  What's a Genetic Algorithm?

A **genetic algorithm** is a smart way for computers to "learn" solutions. It mimics evolution:
- Many random paths (like "genes") are tested.
- The best ones survive.
- Over time, the algorithm finds a good way to solve the maze!

Features
  Solves custom mazes using evolution

  You can watch each generation in real time

  Fully browser-based â€” no extra software needed

  Adjustable settings for maze size, speed, and population
